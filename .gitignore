functionality to delete skills - determine route, create UI, basic styling, define route on server, code & export controller action



  MISC QUESTIONS!
-in routes/skills.js - export router - which part is exporting? ONLY top thing? or also router.app?

what does "update imports" in vs code actually change?
questions - how to test along the way if nodemon crash?
making folders mouse vs. terminal?
